**This is fourth week of CoreCode Fullstack bootcamp!**<br><br>
We had sometime to learn new arroay and string methos for Javascript<br>
We started with the differences between <<For In>> and <<For Of>> wich are lsited below:<br>
 | For In  | For Of |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Works on objects   | Works on arrays and strings  |
| Loops through properties | Loops through items |
| Lists and object's properties | Lists an array's elements|<br>
  
 *More array methods...*<br>
  **.filter** filters elements of an array up to specific conditions.<br>
  **.reduce** reduces an array's elements.<br>
  **map** creates a new array with the results of applying a function.<br><br>
  
  **RegEx**<br>
  Is used to find patterns into strings. It finds patterns by validating conditions and searches through the text (string).<br>
