**This is the eleventh week of the CoreCode fundamentals bootcamp**<br><br>
On Tuesday, we learnts about node JS and figured out the follwing questions. (I wrote the answers from what I learnt) 
1. What is Node.JS?<br> *It is a runtime environment that allows to run JS code outside a browser.*<br><br>
2. What problem does Node.JS solve?<br>*Non-blocking I/O responses*<br><br>
3. What is the V8 Javascript Engine?<br>*V8 is an open source runtime engine written in C++, which means that it executes JavaScript code.*<br><br>
4. Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?<br>*It is very helpful; not mandatory, though. It offers unique features to be more efficient.*<br><br>
5. What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?<br>*On a browser, JavaScript is enclosed and restricted to operate on the browser only due to security reasons. Node.JS has full access to the system such as any other native app.*<br><br>
6. What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?<br>*It stands for "Node Version Manager" and it is a tool that allows to install and manage different Node versions on the device. With NVM, there is no need to uninstall and install different versions of Node when working on an X version app.*<br><br>

We also learnt about Node.JS Module System. We answered the following questions:<br>
1. What is a Javascript Module?<br>*It is a JS file with its own code that can be exported and imported to be used on a different JS file*<br><br>
2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?<br>*It makes code easier to understand and read by breaking the code into smaller pieces.*<br><br>
3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?<br>*None, module standards are available on ES6 only.*<br><br>
4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?<br>*Common JS Modules: Every file is a module and it is isolated. Also, we can define can be exported from the file. They can be used only inside Node.Js. Script invoking is different. <br>ES Modules: They can be used on browsers. We use export default instead of export.modules. *<br><br>
5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?<br>*Core Modules, local Modules and Third-party Modules*<br><br>

The last portion of the session was about "Client-Server Model" so we answered the following questions:<br>
1. What is a Server?<br>*In few words, it is a remote computer that provides data and services*<br><br>
2. Why is a Client?<br>*It is the person using a service through a device such as a computer or a smartphone.*<br><br>
3. Is a server just another physical computer?<br>* *<br><br>
   - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?<br>* *<br><br>
   - What is the difference?<br>* *<br><br>
4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?<br>*Yes, we have a sender, encoding, a message, a receiver and a feedback. We may also experience noise.*<br><br>
5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?<br>*It is applicable to any type of app that requires interaction*<br><br>
   - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?<br>*Social media apps*<br><br>
