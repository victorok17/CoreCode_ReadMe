**This is thirteenth week of CoreCode Fullstack bootcamp!**<br>
We have been working on our project. As well, I create and uploaded my first repository.<br>
It is a Contact List and I used React to create it.<br>
You can check it [here](https://github.com/victorok17/first_react_project)<br><br>

We also learnt about S.O.L.I.D<br>
