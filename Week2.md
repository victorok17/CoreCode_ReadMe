**This is second week of CoreCode Fullstack bootcamp!**<br>
The first activity was to do research about Js conditions, loops and functions. So, by reading MDN, I learnt that there are three types of conditions:
- If: *executes a statement if a condition is thruthy.*
- If... else *executes a statement whether the condition is truthy or falsy.*
- Else if *specifies more conditions*<br>

A function is a group of instructions that complete a task or calculate a value.<br>

Loops are cicles that repeated until a condition is truthy. There are three types of loops:<br>
- For *is a loop that consists in three expressions and finishes when they are all three completed.*<br>
- While *executes a specific instruction as long as the condition is truthy.*<br>
- Do...while *executes the code until the condition is truthy at least one time.*<br>

**Exercises**<br>
*Solution to multiply exercise:*<br>
```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
console.log(multiply (2, 2));
