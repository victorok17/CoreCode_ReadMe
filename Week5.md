**Functional Programming vs. Object Oriented Programming**<br>

| Functional Programming  | Object Oriented Programming|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| It is problem solving  | Good for fixed set of operations on things  |
| Allows pure functions (meaning they do not include side effects)  | Allows to create a "template" that can be applied to multiple objects |
| Its control flow is strict and easy tor ead  | Code can be hidden and implemented to different objects  |

**Fundamental concepts of OOP:**<br>
*Object*: It's the element that receives the code<br>
*Abstracion*: To simplify reality. It also means to create a less complex code<br>
*Class*: It is a template to create multiple objects and store their data and properties<br>
*Encapsulation*: It is information hiding to keep it safe<br>
*Inheritance*: A class derives from an object to others<br>
*Polymorphism*: A class can implement a method in its own way<br><br>

**Getting started with Typescript**<br>
*What is typescript?*<br>
It is an open-source language developed by Miscrosoft. It is a Javascript subset, which means it is derived frlom Js.<br>
Typescript needs to be compiled into a .js to be executed in a browser.<br>
A .ts file is created on the runtime environemnt on node.<br><br>
I feel proud of myself since it is my first time using the terminal on my computer and succesuflly installed node.js and Typescript
