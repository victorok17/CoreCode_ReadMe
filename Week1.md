**Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages**<br>
A Programming Language is a set of rules and instructions for a machine to execute. <br>
There are three types of Programming Languages:
1. Compiled language *is a language where the source code requires to be compiled by a program, sent to the target machine and then executed.* They are usually faster, but requires specific software to be run.
2. Interpreted language *is a language whenre the source code is directly sent to the target machine to be translated and executed by a different program.* They might be slower executed, but it is more likele to be interpreted by multiple platforms.
3. Hybrid language *combines both languages, which means that the source code is compiled, sent to the target machine and interpreted.*<br>
Java is a *Hybrid* language since it is compiled into a bytecode file (.class), sent  to the target machine where is interpreted by JVM and converts it into machine code. <br>

**My year of birth in Matrix.**<br>
I was asked to enter convert my year of birth (1996) into binary. It is 11111001100. <br>
Here's the math!![82d48588-e204-48c3-a53e-9e6a8199173c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109565598/180112739-c62c819f-79cd-4048-a8a7-d93d0d95c037.jpg)

**MIPS programming langague**<br>
We did a quick overview of MIPS which stands for *Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages*. This is low-level programming language used to assembly MIPS processors.<br>
The overview included commands and instructions to create a program that displays "hello world" and a program that asks for two numbers and prints the first one.
